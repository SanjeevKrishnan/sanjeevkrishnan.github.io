               Our team Navaritih aims to design an office building for global consulting and IT services company Infosys
               limited at their Mohali campus. our main goal for this project is to design a net zero energy office
               building. We aspire to develop techniques to design energy and water efficient, affordable and resilient
               building with careful considerations to comfort, environmental quality and market potential. With
               innovative techniques we strive to design consciously and optimize the space design, façade system, and
               building management system.
               Our goal was to design energy efficient building also to design a building which reduces Water usage
               through Recycling of water by reduce, reuse and recycling methods, promotes onsite Energy generation
               through Solar, Wind and Biomass Energy Sources, a resilient building which has the ability to reduce the
               magnitude and/or duration of disruptive events.

               Energy is required in a large quantity for the building operations for the period of their whole lives. About
               40 % of the total energy is consumed by buildings. Key issues in sustainability are depletion of resources
               and environmental pollution. It includes physical resources like fossil fuels, materials, and the human
               resources, at this point in time, if we still rely on these materials, we will have a big problem in future
               since we will no longer be able to extract enough material to meet the supply.

               By using energy efficient techniques like efficient lighting design, optimized daylight, shading devices,
               optimized orientation and shape through simulations on various software's and considering all the design
               guidelines, we tried to provide a climate responsive and efficient design.

               Special features of this building are windows having double glazed glass with low u value, Cavity walls
               with insulation, hollow concrete blocks, Sun exposed roof is insulated, use of efficient plumbing fixtures
               plus only recycled water is used for irrigation, lower flow rates in water taps and use of control systems,
               installation of sensors and use locally available materials.]]></page><page Index="6"><![CDATA[4.  TEAM INTRODUCTION

               Approach

               Workflow in the team:
               We have divided our team according to the 10 contests provided in the design brief, each team member
               was provided with a contest according to their area of interest.  All team members are  free to give their
               suggestions for the whole design process but their prime focus will be on the contest selected by them
               .Each contest has a individual lead and the team is led by 2 team leaders who will manage the whole team
               and motivate all the team members to achieve goals and develop the required skill set to get results.
               Process:
               After deciding our goals to design a Net zero energy water building, the process starts with site potential
               analysis, location, orientation, climate analysis and consideration of other parameters which are required
               to enhance the building design. We will incorporate energy use, water consumption, comfort, affordability,
               resilience, technical aspects and all the contests given to us as challenges in design. By incorporating some
               of the design features like prefabricated walls, solar passive design elements, radiant heating system, usage
               of vernacular materials, rainwater harvesting system we aspire to achieve our goals.

                 vi.   Water systems

                             Consumption reduction strategies

                   •    Waterless urinals
                   •    Efficient aerated faucets
                   •    Efficient
                   •    Use of municipal water and balance that consumption with ground water recharge.

                   For controlling the groundwater recharge a water body is introduced which provides enough time for
                   soaking up that amount of water and also control and store the water to be used in unfavorable
                   conditions.
                   Another system is introduced to break the speed of stormwater to settle down the dust and other
                   suspended particles to the sedimentation chambers attached just after the speed breakers.]]></page><page Index="9"><![CDATA[7.  GOALS

               Thermally Activated Building System (TABS) is used for the radiant heating and cooling of the building.
               As the tubing used in the system is embedded in the floor slabs, the size of the visible components like
               ducts and AHU’s can be reduced, resulting in reduced floor to floor building heights. The embedded
               tubing system requires no maintenance including the chilled water source and distribution. The DOAS
               system used by the radiant cooling system not only reduce the operation costs but make a significant
               difference in the capital costs.

                   •  Water performance
               To improve the water consumption, Faucet Aerator with sensor is used in the faucets. It is water
               efficient and low maintenance.

               For harvesting rainwater, a water body is used on the site instead of constructing a large tank.
                   •  Structure system

               A flat slab system is used in the structure system, which gives flexibility in the design layout. It will
               reduce the floor-to-floor height resulting in reduced building height and foundation load. It takes less
               time in construction and M & E services can be easily installed on it.

                   •  BIM 5D sequencing

               In conventional estimating techniques, where we use 2D drawings there will be a chance of inefficiency
               and error, but a three-dimensional project model removes the ambiguity and potential inconsistencies
               in project quantity estimations.

               In BIM we can automatically generate the quantities from the model itself. Provides cost loaded
               schedules and the data can be queried at any time during a project and the information that feeds cost
               reports is regularly updated.

               Design strategies for economy and cost of finance in construction

                   •  Materials

               The materials used in the facade system are used on the preference of their availability in the local
               market. This will reduce the embodied carbon and make the process more sustainable.

               AAC blocks used for walls will reduce the construction time due to their size and thus construction cost
               will also be reduced.

               Problem Definition

               In maintaining the energy efficiency of the building, building automation plays an important role. With the
               rise of modern technologies and inventions in the field of building automation, the energy-saving capacity
               of buildings has exponentially risen. In fact, sensors, actuators, and controllers, which collectively serve as
               the backbone of cyber physical systems for building energy management, are one of the core technical
               areas of investment for achieving the goals for energy affordability being mentioned by various standards.
               But, at the same time, installation and maintenance of these sensors, actuators and controllers is not an
               easy task. Starting from selecting the appropriate sensors, designing the network, installation, testing to
               regular maintenance of these networks needs a lot of effort and resources. A lot of money and human
               resource is being deployed at this section to achieve that exponential level of energy saving. Even after
               spending a lot of resources on this, it is highly prone to hardware errors and even a small error can halt the
               whole  automation  system  of  the  building  which  in  turn  would  increase  the  energy  consumption  and
               operational cost. Especially in office buildings, where building automation is done on a large scale, it has a
               very big impact. To solve this issue, a lot of resources are being done to increase the efficiency of the sensor,
               actuator  and  controller network  itself,  like  wireless  sensors,  smart  sensors etc.  But  still,  a remarkable
               solution  is  not  yet  achieved.  We  seek  to  address  this  problem  by  proposing  a  sensor  less  building
               automation system.

               Proposed Solution

               We have designed an IT office building. The core job being carried out here is through computers and
               computer network.  Every individual has a LAN port near to his table and his computer, in which he works
               for almost 85% of his total presence time within that building. All these computers are connected to the
               local server and the total data transfer happens through it. We primarily aim to estimate the current
               occupancy of an area by analysing the traffic of data in that particular area and hence operate necessary
               systems accordingly. With this, we can sense the occupancy and control the lighting and other electric
               fixtures accordingly. When it comes to sensing the thermal comfort of the occupants, we aim to develop
               an AI model which will be deployed at the server. This model will analyse the data being transferred from/to
               an individual’s computer and predicts his thermal comfort. We expect this model to produce results at high]]></page><page Index="26"><![CDATA[accuracy because the output of any person is strongly related to his thermal comfort. Other factors related
               to the output of an individual will not affect the accuracy of our model because we plan to train our model
               with a vast dataset from various office types, various regions, various age groups, various shift schedules,
               various time frames etc. By predicting thermal comfort, HVAC systems  can be operated efficiently. By
               estimating the occupancy and predicting the thermal comfort just through the data traffic, we aim to totally
               remove all kind of sensors present in primary functional spaces like office spaces, meeting rooms etc.,
               except water management sensors. For rest of the spaces like cafeteria, toilets, lounges etc., the occupancy
               will be predicted using AI model by taking inputs like the total current occupancy of the building (from the
               electronic attendance record), current occupancy of office spaces, and other relevant data. Our secondary
               aim is to deploy an RL (Reinforced Learning) model which can continuously take inputs from the users to
               increase the accuracy of the results produced. On the other side, we will use wireless, internet-connected
               fixtures, actuators and controllers where each element will have its own address in the network. By this, it
               is very easy to operate these components, installation and maintenance cost is less, and if any error is
               spotted it is very easy to locate it and fix it without affecting the rest of the system.

               Target Market
               Our primary target is office buildings where computer network forms the core of the office functioning. As
               we are only dependent on core hardware of such offices and no other extra hardware are required, it is
               very easy to implement our solution in their offices. Not only in ‘under-construction’ or ‘to-be-constructed'
               buildings, even in functioning offices, it is easy to implement our solution with nearly zero opportunity cost.
               At  the  same  time,  with  modifications  in  the  model  employed,  the  solution  can  be  implemented  in
               educational campuses, and other campuses where network of computational devices is available in large
               scale.

               Challenges and Strategies

               Major advantage of this innovation is there are almost no challenges in implementing our solution in our
               target market. The only but major challenge is collecting dataset to train our AI model. For this we need to
               tie up with various offices across the World. Though we are just concerned about the quantity of data being
               transferred, authorities or administrators might not feel comfortable to let us have control on their data
               traffic data. To face this challenge, we have thought upon few strategies. Our client, Infosys, has branches
               in 14 cities with multiple office buildings in these cities. They can form a huge source of dataset for us. We
               plan to design a data collection portal where respondents can easily enter necessary data without any
               hinderance. We also plan to make MoUs with few large IT companies where we can provide them our
               product with concession in return to dataset for training our model.

               Market Impact

               Our  solution,  once  introduced  in  market,  will  make  a  remarkable  impact.  As  mentioned  earlier,  the
               installation and operational cost is almost zero. Anyone from the target market can easily implement our
               system.  Because  of  this  cost  and  resource  savings,  more  people  will  be  ready  to  implement  building
               automation system in their buildings, which not only improves our business but also a vast amount of
               energy will be saved.]]></page><page Index="27"><![CDATA[F.  SCALABILITY AND MARKET POTENTIAL

               Smart Buildings for A Smart City

               Smart autonomous office buildings are the secret sauce for a smart city. IT based offices are flooding the
               nation. It is one of the sectors with high money flow. The scope for IT office building is really high at least
               for the next one decade. We have designed in such a way that it would meet the need of all kind of clients
               present in the market. Our design is not client-need specific. At the same time, we didn’t fail to meet the
               expectations of our project partner. So, it is very easy to implement this kind of design anywhere in the
               country.
               Climate responsiveness is the only factor to consider in such a case. But as we have achieved the climate
               responsiveness mostly through materials, just altering the materials accordingly would help us. Also, the
               office space within each floor is modular. It can be multiplied or reduced as per the need.

               The building automation system which we propose to innovate will be of great demand in market. There
               is not much infrastructure to install. It is mostly software based. Hence, it is easy to implement in existing
               buildings as well. Also, that system is not constrained to use within IT offices. It will be of great use in
               spaces like Universities, Libraries, Large office spaces, etc.



               CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUE

               Precast construction technique is used is flat slab systems. This has many advantages over conventional
               construction system. Precast technique saves time and hence reduce cost of construction in terms of
               material and labour.

               Passive strategies to achieve thermal comfort

               Initial design annual solar radiation analysis
               Through annual Radiation analysis on the building envelope on our initial design we concluded that south,
               east, and west façade receive most of the solar radiation.











               Figure 25: South and West annual radiation analysis   Figure 26: North and East annual radiation analysis


               Longer east-west direction was chosen for this project as distribution of the solar radiation densely during
               the winter months and less during the summer months in the south wall, makes this orientation
               favorable. Glass faced has been chosen for north façade as it receives least solar radiation. South west
               and east walls receive most solar radiation which ultimately results in heat gain. These walls need extra
               insulation to avoid heat gain in the building. Selection of materials and providing extra insulation where
               needed was one of the key design strategies. Designing shading devices to cut off the Summer Sun and
               maximize the Winter Sun was needed to achieve thermal comfort.

               Final design annual solar radiation analysis







               Figure 27: Solar radiation on the North building envelope   Figure 28: Solar radiation on the South building envelope


               As initial analysis we concluded that south, east, and west façade receive the maximum solar radiation,
               we cut down the solar radiation on the southern side by using optimized shading devices on the southern
               façade. And protected the roof and south and west façade by using a double skin façade element which
               covers the whole building from top, east, and west side. Providing an extra layer which cuts down the
               solar radiation falling on the roof hence benefit in reducing heat gain and help in achieving thermal
               comfort. Glazing is provided in north façade to provide adequate daylight as most of the office spaces are
               placed along the north façade. Light shelves are used in this façade to provide deep penetration of day
               light inside the interiors.]]></page><page Index="30"><![CDATA[Figure 30: south façade with optimized shading devices   Figure 29: Facade design details with

               HVAC System:

               Considering climate conditions of Mohali and project partner requirements, Radiant Cooling System
               integrated with a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) for cooling and ventilation is used in this project.

               •  Radiant Cooling System: Thermally Activated Building System (TABS) is a combined heating and
                   cooling system with pipes embedded in the structural concrete slabs or walls of Multi-Storey
                   buildings. TABS operates at temperature close to ambient enabling more efficient utilization of
                   renewable and free cooling sources. Moreover, it provides optimized thermal indoor environment.
               •  Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS):  A DOAS provides fresh dehumidified air to the building.
                   Radiant cooling system removes only sensible heat from the building but to handle latent heat loads
                   DOAS system is required.

               Natural ventilation

               •  Orientation: Building is oriented in prevailing wind direction which provides maximum ventilation to
                   the building.
               •  Building shape: thinner building shape is used in the design to increase the ratio of surface area to
                   volume which is helping in ventilating building naturally. This strategy not only helps in cross
                   ventilation but also helping in stack effect.
               •  Operable windows: South façade window inlets are operable which allows to adjust the flow of fresh
                   air inside the building

               Mechanical ventilation

               It is used in the building to improve indoor air quality, and control humidity, odors and contaminants
               through dilution and replacement with outside air.

               Site,  Landscape  and  Urban  design  strategies  for  achieving  reducing  thermal  stress  in  the  outdoor
               environment:

               Site vegetation and landscape elements affect the outdoor thermal comfort for the encompassing
               buildings in composite climate like Mohali. In order to improve the outdoor thermal environment of
               attached urban morphologies in Mohali Infosys Campus, the streets and the spaces between buildings
               must be taken into account in the urban and landscape design processes.

               Vegetation is used in design for energy conservation in our office building in the following ways:

                   •  Shading of buildings and open spaces through landscaping with native plants
                   •  Terrace gardens with adjacent workspace
                   •  Shading of vertical and horizontal surfaces
                   •  Buffer against cold and hot winds
                   •  Changing the wind direction

               Landscape and vegetation also alter the micro-climate of our design site and was used as micro-climate
               manager for as long as buildings have been built. This was possible through evapotranspiration.

               Plantation also shading building surfaces in west and southern facade and open ground, thus inducing lower
               surface temperatures and it does not vary much even when exposed to harsh radiation occasionally during
               hot seasons. we are considering semi outdoor terrace gardens for reducing heat loads in office workspace
               and working as shading devices for our façade. The green cover lowers ambient temperatures through
               evapotranspiration.

               As the entrance is in the north façade which will be shaded by building shade through during the harsh
               hours of the day. There is a water body on the northern side of the façade which is helping in evaporative

               AAC Blocks for exterior walls

                AAC is lightweight precast foam concrete. Its advantages are:
               Lightweight

               AAC Blocks are three to four times lighter than traditional brick; therefore, more suitable and cheaper to
               transport Block weighs approximately 50% less than standard concrete masonry block, and usage reduces
               the overall dead load of the building thereby allowing construction of the taller building

               Easy Workability and design flexibility
               Blocks can be easily cut drilled nailed and grooved to fit individual requirements available in custom sizes
               simplifies hydro sanitary and electrical installations such as pipes or ducts, which we can install after the
               completion of the leading construction.

               Faster Construction

               Reduces construction time by 20% different sizes of blocks helps reduce the number of joints in wall
               masonry, lighter blocks facilitate more comfortable and faster construction. These blocks are easy to
               install also sets and hardens quickly.]]></page><page Index="44"><![CDATA[Minimum Wastages

               AAC blocks have negligible breakage less than 5%; hence utilization of blocks increases.

               Thermal insulation and energy-efficient

               These blocks allow excellent thermal insulation due to tiny air pores and thermal mass of blocks. Hence
               helps in reducing heating and air conditioning costs of a building.
               Eco friendly and sustainable

               Mix productive use of recycled Industrial waste is a fly ash non-polluting manufacturing process. The only
               by-product is steam made of non-toxic ingredients that do not exist gasses.

               Acoustic performance

               Superior sound absorption qualities due to the porous structure of block offer sound attenuation of about
               42 decibels blocking out all significant sounds and disturbances.

               Fire-resistant

               AAC blocks are non-combustible and fire-resistant up to 1600 degrees Celsius. These blocks are fire-
               resistant approximately 2 to 6 hours, depends on the thickness of the Wall.

               Cost-saving

               The requirement for plaster on AAC blocks is less due to the surface accuracy of the blocks, thus reduces
               overall construction cost by 2.5 %. Since it requires less jointing hence minimizes the demand for cement
               and steel. AAC block has high insulation properties, which help in saving energy costs by almost 30%.

               Seismic resistant

               The manufacturing process gives the blocks excellent strength maintaining its lightweight property due to
               which the steadiness of these blocks in buildings is more reliable, making it earthquake resistant.

               Accuracy

               ACC blocks offer high precision in size. Blocks are available in exact dimensions to provide a smooth wall
               with a perfect joint between different elements. It also helps to save cement and steel usage.

               Termite pest-resistant

               The blocks are made with inorganic materials; hence it keeps termites away, avoiding damages and
               losses.

               Water saver

               AAC Block walls do not require water for curing. Only the mortar joints need water for curing, thus
               reduces water consumption.]]></page><page Index="45"><![CDATA[Drywall for Internal Partitions:

               Affordability
               Drywall and Drywall service is affordable for just about everyone. Its cost efficiency makes it a highly
               popular choice for homeowners. It is much more affordable than plaster walls or paneling. Combine the
               affordability of drywall with its ease of installation and repair, and it makes for a wildly popular choice.
               Not only is the drywall itself affordable, but so is the repair or replacement of it.
               Beauty and Elegance
               There is a simple yet elegant beauty to drywall for homes or offices. It can be painted multiple times,
               allowing you to change the look and feel of a room quickly and easily. When properly installed, drywall is
               easily one of the best-looking materials available and affordable for most people. Get in touch with a
               drywall contractor or drywall expert for service today.
               Insulation Properties
               When it comes to insulation, not many affordable materials can compare to drywall. It helps any room
               retain its temperature, whether it’s cold air or warm air. Improved insulation will not only make your
               rooms cozier and more comfortable; it will also lower your energy bill costs all year long. Heaters won’t
               need to work as hard to keep rooms with drywall warm. The same is true for air conditioners and drywall.
               A competent drywall technician can explain this to you further.
               Fire Resistant Properties
               Drywall slows down the spreading of fires. This greatly aids in the containment of fires in your home or
               office. The safety benefits of drywall alone make it well worth the cost, which is already low! Drywall can
               slow down a fire and potentially save your home or office from further damage. Furthermore, it may even
               aid in the saving of the most precious commodity on the planet; life. Always call a credible company for
               drywall installation and repair service.
               Ease of Repair and Installation

               In Mohali, the summers are short, sweltering, and clear and the winters are short, cool, dry, and mostly
               clear.

               As it is an office building, internal thermal load is higher than external thermal load because of denser
               occupancy and a greater number of electrical and electronics appliances.

               As per the climatic conditions of Mohali and the project partner requirements, it is decided to use a
               Radiant Cooling System integrated with a Dedicated Outdoor Air System (DOAS) for cooling and
               ventilation purposes respectively. As the occupancy is high, latent heat load is high inside and radiant
               cooling system cannot take care of latent head load, DOAS is necessary.

               Radiant Cooling System:
               There are different types of radiant systems. But here we are using a Thermally Activated Building System
               (TABS).

               The Thermally Activated Building System (TABS) is a combined heating and cooling system with pipes
               embedded in the structural concrete slabs or walls of multi-Storey buildings. TABS operates at
               temperature close to ambient enabling more efficient utilization of renewable and free cooling sources.
               Moreover, it provides optimized thermal indoor environment.

               DOAS:

               Radiant systems can only remove sensible loads from the building. To handle latent loads a DOAS needs
               to be installed. A DOAS provides fresh dehumidified air to the building.

               An Energy Recovery Wheel (ERW) or Enthalpy wheel is also to be used in DOAS to utilize the useful energy
               from the return air. Rather than discard used building air, an enthalpy wheel salvages useful energy and
               transfers it to incoming, fresh air.]]></page><page Index="48"><![CDATA[The summary of design load calculations and system sizing is given below.

               What are we proposing?
               The proposal contains a design ready net zero energy and water building, it does not only support to sustain
               the environment in which we live but also provides resources for our daily needs without being exploiting
               it from the mother nature. The additional benefits are towards operational cost reduction by reducing the
               energy demand to significant amount.

               How have we achieved this?
               The steps towards a net zero energy and water building started with the understanding of site climate,
               design requirements, available renewable resources, and economic benefits towards operational expenses.

                The  provided  solutions  are  the  practical  integration  of  different  functional  components  towards  the
               requirements.

               Steps towards achieving a net zero energy building.

                   •  Design considerations from the very beginning.
                              The design considerations from the initial stages helps reduce the additional cost which we need
               to put in the construction and get back as payback later. The earlier you start considering the net zero
               energy approach the easy and economical it will achieve it.

                       Energy demand calculations are done at initial stages which acts as benchmark and it is reduced to
                       match the energy generation through optimized fenestration ratio and efficient building envelop.]]></page><page Index="52"><![CDATA[Figure 64: Facade fenestration and envelope optimization through shading and reducing window-wall ratio.
               These are the initial load reduction by design considerations which helps to achieve lower operational
               costs.

               Steps towards achieving a net zero water building.

                   •  On-site resource calculations

                                 Available amount of annual rainwater harvesting is calculated and and is compared with the
               demand and recycled water is supplied to possible area

                   •  Reduction techniques

                              To match the demand with the harvested amount of rainwater water efficient fixtures are used.

               Cost analysis
               The operational cost has a significant share in the life cycle cost of the building, since Infosys owns and
               operates the building, its beneficial to pay lower operational cost throughout the life of building with
               nominal additional construction expenses.

               For office typology of buildings, the operational costs are more significant as its important to achieve the
               required level of comfort to create a healthy and comfortable environment.]]></page><page Index="53"><![CDATA[11.   APPENDIX B]]></page><page Index="54"><![CDATA[]]></page></pages></Search>
